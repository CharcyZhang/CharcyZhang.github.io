      Discrimination inside Luxury Stores

        <p>Do you have such kind of experience? Imagine that when walking into a luxury store, what showed up first is not the sales that are willing to help you, but the pairs of eyes that are staring on you. What are they looking at? Your normal clothes or your face without any makeup? What ended up is ignorance, and an unpleasant shopping experience. However, the situation became completely different when the same person with a delicate makeup on came into the store.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>From the prospective of the sales, choosing who to serve according to the appearance might be their simplest way to increase the amount of things they sold out. It seems to be a mindset that who ever have makeups and good-looks owns the best services and have the ability to buy luxuries, whereas others who don’t decorate themselves a lot do not have that opportunity.</p>
<p>Using this method to sell luxuries somehow may really increase the possibility of success. However, because of the choice sales made to decide who to serve, caused thousands of customers became not confident about their outlooks.</p>
<p>The different attitude toward the customers because of their appearance is a great damage on the self-confidence of the customers, and created a loads of worries . According to the Mental Health Foundation, in UK, one in five adult felt ashamed about their appearance.What’s something more unbelievable is that there are one in eight adults that had thought about suicide only because their imperfect appearance.Think about it, a judgement when selling luxuries can actually lead to the death of many innocents. </p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report done by Danielle Pergament a travel writer for The New York Times described that there are 80% of people in a sample of 2500 that believes everyone judges other people’s look. More and more people are becoming anxious of their appearance, and didn’t owed the services they should have.The next time stepping into luxury stores, everyone might start thinking about, do they have a good appearance? Are they looking good enough to earn the service from the sales? </p>
<p>This problem is not only about judging from outlook or appearance that can be easily improved through makeups and plastic surgeries, but also from something unchangeable. In 2012, Cheryl Johnson, an African-American woman was accused of stealing a dress. No one listened to her explanation, only because of her skin color. The depressing sound of saying “I didn’t stole anything.” was finally believed until the theft is caught. How did you feel? Worried? Anxious? Could you imagine that how many more people are suffering from this discrimination that can easily happen?</p>
<p>We should start doing something to stop this from happening! In order to eliminate the discrimination inside the luxury store and to provide people with equal services, solutions are needed.</p>
<p>The first suggestion is for the teachers in school. Stop judging people only from their appearance is an important lesson that should be taught to the students. Everyone deserves the same rights, no matter how beautiful you are. Wealth, appearance and personality should be three separated subjects, and should be avoided of discussing together. Secondly, for the adults already stepped into the society. Posters and advertisements can be showed inside public places, such as subway stations. Videos or pictures about stopping the discrimination can be posted on the internet.Most importantly, when luxury stores are training the employees, they should be taught not to judge a person from their dressing and outlook. Every customer have the right to be served, even they might not actually buy the luxury.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin, an American writer, scientist, inventor, political philosopher says that “Don’t judge men’s wealth or goodness by their Sunday appearance.” The next time walking into a luxury store, I wish everyone can see a smiling face that is willing to help no matter what we wear or look like.</p>
